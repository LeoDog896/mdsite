Render URLs as Markdown.

## Usage

1. Type
   [`{{base}}https://example.com`]({{base}}https://example.com)
   in your browser.
2. Enjoy the rendered Markdown.

## Queries

- Appending `?raw` to the URL will return the raw Markdown.
- Appending `?html` to the URL will return the raw HTML.
- Appending `?no-rebase` to the URL will return the the page without
  redirecting to itself.

You can use any combination of these queries: [https://example.com?raw&no-rebase]({{base}}https://example.com?raw&no-rebase)
